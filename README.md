# Animal Kingdom
## Example of Inheritance and Encapsulation
### Made an Animal Super Class and a Mammal Sub Class
### Understood Inheritance and Encapsulation using this example

### Inheritance allows to use functions and attributes from a class by importing the super class into the sub class and writing the following code:

~~~
    class Mammal(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
~~~
